# Experiments in DOS programming in x86 Assembly Language

Assembly language was my second programming language after BASIC. I learned BASIC while in 6th grade on an IBM PC XT that booted DOS 3.3 (on a 5.25in floppy) and had GW-BASIC on a another floppy disk. That summer after school, my dad gave me two programming books. One was for PASCAL and the other was for assembly Language. While I have forgotten the title and the author of the PASCAL book, that was not the case with the assembly language book. Leo J. Scanlon's **8086/8088/80286 Assembly Language book** got me so hooked that even though I have never used assembly language in any professional capacity, programming in it became my hobby through high school and early college, when assembly language was no longer in vogue.

I am collecting in this repository all my recent experiments with the language, plus any other projects/source codes I can dig up from my paper archives. I made lots of effort to test these programs in DOSBOX as well as in VirtualBox 7.0 (using MS-DOS 6.22, DR DOS 6.0, and FreeDOS 1.3). For the assembler and linker, I use Borland's TurboAssembler (TASM) version 5.1. With minor (if any) modifications, it could be made to work with Microsoft's Macro Assembler (MASM).
